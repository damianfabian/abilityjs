## Ability-js

A simple route-based ACL component for express.js. This won't handle actual authentication, you can use everyauth for that.

## Installing

    npm install ability

## With everyauth:

This assumes you have, in your everyauth setup, a field called "role" (customizable, see below). For example, if you're using facebook:       

```javascript
everyauth.facebook.extractExtraRegistrationParams( function (req) {
  return {
    role: "some default role"
  }
});
```
Obviously this doesn't make much sense without persistence, so you can change the roles, but you can achieve that with mongoose-auth or a custom solution.
    
If you have everyauth working in an expressjs app, all you have to do to your app.js is add the following

```javascript
abilities = {
  editor: {
    index: ['read'],
    protected: ['read']
  },
  default: {
    index: ['read'],
  }
}
var ability = require('ability');
ability.add(abilities);
```

This is route-based, and assumes you're going to have 2 routes, `app.get /protected` and `app.get /`.
**Note**: You must specify a 'default'.

Then, in the route:

```javascript
app.get('/protected', function(req, res) {
  authorize();
  res.render('protected');
});
```

This will check to see if the user is authorized based on the setup above. According to the above setup, an un-authenticated user would not be authorized for this route. 

Optionally, you can specify the action and route:

```javascript
app.get('/protected', function(req, res) {
  authorize('read', 'index');
  res.render('protected');
});
```

Even further, you can specify the role you want to check

```javascript
app.get('/protected', function(req, res) {
  authorize('read', 'index', 'default');
  res.render('protected');
});
```

Now you could use authorizeHandler as a middleware with your express application:
```javascript
app.get('/protected', authorizeHandler, function(req, res) {
  res.render('protected');
});
```
This will check from the req if you have a valid user entity, check the property you had configured in ability as the role property name and it will validate if it's authorize to see the resource.

###Route translations:

On the routes, you may specify one of 4 options, 'read', 'write', 'delete', or 'all'. 

1. Read -> Get
2. Write -> Put/post
3. Delete -> Delete
4. All -> Read/Write/Delete

## Options
	
	ability = require('ability');
    ability.configure({
    	redirect: true,
    	role_name: role,
    	redirect_to: '/',
    	redirect_message: 'Unauthorized'
    })

- redirect, whether or not to redirect to the user if they're not authorized. By default, it will redirect a user to the home page if they're not authorized, without a flash. 

- redirect_to, where to redirect the user if authentication fails

- redirect_message, if you're using req.flash, it will put the messages in there

- role_name, the name of the everyauth field for your role (everyauth only)


## Todo:

- Thinking on that


NOTE: I just take the old source and make some changes to used in my project with express v4, I'm plannig to add more feautures on the route, but for now I'm happy to be available to use this simple and awesome library. Hope you find this usefull.
